💡 Problem Statement – SynergySphere

To design and build a desktop and mobile-ready platform that acts 
like a central nervous system for team collaboration. SynergySphere should not only 
streamline the basics like tasks and communication but also work proactively — catching 
potential issues early and helping teams stay ahead rather than constantly reacting. 
This means creating a system that feels supportive, insightful, and seamless — something that 
naturally fits into the rhythm of a working team.
